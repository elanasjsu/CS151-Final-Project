Here is how the classes depend and interoperate with each other:

The main data set is DateSet which holds an arraylist of DateItems.

DateItems contain a Date and a ToDoList.

ToDoLists are comprised of ListItems.

Calendar retrieves all the DateItems from the DateSet with the same 
month & year and displays them.

When a DateItem is selected on the Calendar, the DateSet selectedDateItem
is updated, which will automatically update the ToDoListFrame.

The ToDoListFrame displays the selectedDateItem's Date and ToDoList.

When the ToDoList is editted in the ToDoListFrame, the DateSet is updated 
to reflect those changes.
