Here is how the classes depend and interoperate with each other:

The main data set is DateSet which holds an hashtbale of Dates as keys and ToDoList as values.

ToDoLists are comprised of ListItems.

Calendar retrieves all values from the DateSet with the same month & year and displays them.

When a table value is selected on the Calendar, the DateSet selectedEntry
is updated, which will automatically update the ToDoListFrame.

The ToDoListFrame displays the selectedEntry's Date and ToDoList.

When the ToDoList is editted in the ToDoListFrame, the DateSet is updated 
to reflect those changes. 

Classes:
	DateSet -> Hashtable<Date, ToDoList>
	ToDoListFrame -> ToDoList -> ListItems
	Calendar ->
